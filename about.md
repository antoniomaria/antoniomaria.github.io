>Hey there! My name is Antonio SÃ¡nchez, I am an enthusiastic Senior Software engineer and I like working as such, learning and helping others to code better on the way. 

What I like the most is the satisfaction when you get something done, or when someone learn something from me. I am old Java dinosaurs, but always
trying to catch up the latest techs and broadening my scope.  

Thanks for reading!

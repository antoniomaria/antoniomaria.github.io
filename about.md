>Hey there! My name is Antonio Maria Sánchez Berrocal and  I'm an enthusiastic and passional Java developer with 10 years experience developing web projects in all their phases. I started my career in <a href="http://www.ieci.es">Informatica El Corte Inglés</a> (Seville-Spain) and currently I'm working in <a href="http://www.itim.org">Itim International</a>.

It has been a long time since I started to code, but I don't find any "job title" that suits to me, because I have worked as
frontend developer, as backend developer, making integration with third parties application, project coordinator, bug fixer, application architect, technical consultant...

What I like the most is to code in Java using Eclipse using the latest technology available to make Java Web applications.
I took the decision to start writing this blog, to share my knowledge about programming topics in return to all articles, blogs, and stackoverflow answers which have saved me a lot of time.

You can contact me  [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/amsberrocal) or mail me at <mailto:antoniomariasanchez@gmail.com>.

Thanks for reading!

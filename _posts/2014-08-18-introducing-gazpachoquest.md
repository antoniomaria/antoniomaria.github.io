title: Introducing GazpachoQuest
---

[GazpachoQuest](https://github.com/antoniomaria/gazpachoquest) is a Java open source survey or questionnaires tool meant to be an open source alternative for [Survey Monkey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/) or [Qualtrics](http://qualtrics.com/). What makes this application unique is its Rest Centric Architecture, that means all the the features are exposed through REST API. This low decoupling arquitecture makes whoever can customize or built their own user interface on the rest backend.

### Main features

* Start questionnaires or surveys simultaneously for different audience.
* Participants reuse in different surveys.
* Questionnaires full localization support (All text available such as questions, options, pages titles and error messages...). 
* Export or import questionnaires in xml format.
* All questions type supported.
* Flexible questions randomization support. Including shufling questions, flipping pages, and shufling questions inside a page.
* Anonymous or tracked surveys support.

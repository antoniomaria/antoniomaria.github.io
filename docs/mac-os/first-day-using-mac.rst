First day using MacOs Monterey
##############################

One of the beauty of a macOs is that it has already almost everything you need. No much tuning is needed,
However as a old Windows / Linux user I miss some key shortcuts, or favourite editor tools.
You will find here my favourite tools and workarounds to make my life easier.

3. Open Function keys from left pane
4. Toggle "Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys.

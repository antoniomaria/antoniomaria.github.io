MacOS related notes
======================

I am not a devoted Apple user, don't like to be locked in Apple ecosystem, but I admit that for development is a quite nice
option. It has support for cooperative applications, and a BSD based OS which is much handier than an emulator in windows, or
a virtual box. Here I write all my findings, and workarounds using macOs.

I am using:

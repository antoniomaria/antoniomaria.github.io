============================================

Hello there, my name is Antonio Sanchez Berrocal and I am a software developer located in Finland. I code for a living, and learn
on the way. I am writing this for myself and for those who might find this site interesting.
Noticed that sphinx-template this site uses mentioned on the bottom "copyright", donâ€™t take it seriously, too lazy to figure
out to remove it :)
